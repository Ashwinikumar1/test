Optimus Data Transformer Pipeline
Optimus Data Transformer Pipeline is a Python application that applies data transformation to raw data and generates canonical input data. This application uses FastAPI as a web framework to create a RESTful API that accepts the raw data directory path as input and returns the transformed data.

Setup and Installation
Clone the repository
sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/username/Optimus_Data_Transformer_pipeline.git
Install the required packages
sh
Copy code
cd Optimus_Data_Transformer_pipeline
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Start the application server
sh
Copy code
cd Optimus_Data_Transformer_pipeline
uvicorn app:app --reload
Use the curl command to send the POST request to the API
sh
Copy code
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/transform_data -d "raw_data_directory=/path/to/raw/data"
Note: Replace /path/to/raw/data with the actual path of the directory containing raw data files.

API Documentation
The application uses FastAPI to generate an interactive API documentation page. To access the documentation, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000/docs.

please provide me raw readme file 
Sure, here is a template for a README file for the Python application:

Optimus Data Transformer Pipeline
This is a data transformation pipeline that applies data transformation to raw data and generates canonical input data. The pipeline is built with FastAPI, Pandas, and other Python libraries.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or later
Pip package manager
Installation
Clone the repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/<username>/Optimus_Data_Transformer_pipeline.git
Navigate to the project directory

bash
Copy code
cd Optimus_Data_Transformer_pipeline
Install the required packages

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the following command to start the local server

lua
Copy code
uvicorn app:app --reload
The server will start running on http://localhost:8000/.

To transform the data, use the following command:

arduino
Copy code
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/transform_data?raw_data_directory=<path_to_raw_data_directory>"
Replace <path_to_raw_data_directory> with the path to the directory containing the raw data files.

The transformed data will be saved in the canonical_input_data directory located in the OUTPUT_DIR specified in the config.yaml file.

Configuration
The configuration of the pipeline is stored in the config.yaml file located in the configs directory. You can modify the configuration settings according to your requirements.

### Consumer Complaints Data

#### Objective
In this project we will work on complaints textual data against financial companies to extract Company Names and complaints topic using advanced text mining algorithms. 

    1. We will use NER tagging to extract Organisation Names from complaints text
    2. We will use Topic Modelling to extract what complaints was regarding

#### Dataset Info
The dataset comprises of Consumer Complaints on Financial products and weâ€™ll see how to classify consumer complaints text into these categories: Debt collection, Consumer Loan, Mortgage, Credit card, Credit reporting, Student loan, Bank account or service, Payday loan, Money transfers, Other financial service, Prepaid card.

The dataset consist of 670598 rows (complaints) and 18 columns.

For our work we are only interested in complaint Id, Company, Product, Issue and Complaint Narrative.Complaints Narrative will be used for text mining and other columns for evaluating the results.
